I've been reading up on Puppet 3 lately, and came across the
following:

> XMLRPC was the new hotness when development on Puppet started. Now,
> XMLRPC is that horrible thing with the XML and the angle brackets and
> the pain and sad.

(from <http://somethingsinistral.net/blog/the-angry-guide-to-puppet-3/>)

...which also accurately sums up my feelings when I come across yet
another piece of software where someone has decided that XML (or even
JSON) is a good user-facing configuration syntax.
