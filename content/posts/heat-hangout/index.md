I ran a Google Hangout this morning on [Deploying with Heat][1].  You
can find the slides for the presentation on line [here][2], and the
Heat templates (as well as slide sources) are available [on
github][3].

If you have any questions about the presentation, please feel free to
ping me on irc (`larsks`).
