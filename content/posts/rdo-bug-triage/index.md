This Wednesday, January 15, at 14:00 UTC (that's 9AM US/Eastern, or
`date -d "14:00 UTC"` in your local timezone) I will be helping out
with the
[RDO][] [bug triage day][].  We'll be trying to validate all the 
[untriaged bugs][] opened against RDO.

Feel free to drop by on `#rdo` and help out or ask questions.
