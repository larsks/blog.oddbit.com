As long as I'm switching site generators, it seems like a good idea to refresh the comment system as well.  I've been using [Disqus][] for a while, since when I started it was one of the only games in town. There are now alternatives of different sorts, and one in particular caught my eye: [Utterances][] uses GitHub issues for storing comments, which seems like a fantastic idea.

That means that comments will finally be stored in the same place as the blog content, which I think is a happy state of affairs.
