title: Installing nova-docker on Fedora 21/RDO Juno
---

This post comes about indirectly by a request on IRC in `#rdo` for help getting [nova-docker][] installed on Fedora 21.  I ran through the process from start to finish and decided to write everything down for posterity.

## Getting started

I started with the [Fedora 21 Cloud Image][f21], because I'm
installing onto OpenStack and the cloud images include
some features that are useful in this environment.

[f21]: https://getfedora.org/en/cloud/download/

We'll be using OpenStack packages from the [RDO Juno][rdo] repository.
Because there is often some skew between the RDO packages and the
current Fedora selinux policy, we're going to start by putting SELinux
into permissive mode (sorry, Dan):

[rdo]: https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/openstack/openstack-juno/

    # setenforce 0
    # sed -i '/^SELINUX=/ s/=.*/=permissive/' /etc/selinux/config

Next, install the RDO Juno repository:

    # yum -y install \
      https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/openstack/openstack-juno/rdo-release-juno-1.noarch.rpm

And upgrade all our existing packages:

    # yum -y upgrade

## Install OpenStack

We'll be using [packstack][] to install OpenStack onto this host.
Start by installing the package:

[packstack]: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Packstack

    # yum -y install openstack-packstack

And then run a `--allinone` install, which sets up all OpenStack
services on a single host:

    # packstack --allinone

## Install nova-docker prequisites

Once `packstack` has completed successfully, we need to install some
prerequisites for [nova-docker][].

[nova-docker]: https://github.com/stackforge/nova-docker

    # yum -y install git python-pip python-pbr \
      docker-io fedora-repos-rawhide

The `fedora-repos-rawhide` package provides a yum configuration for the
`rawhide` repository (disabled by default).  We're going to need that
to pick up more recent versions of `systemd` (because of [this
bug][rhbz#1187882]) and
`python-six` (because `nova-docker` needs the `six.add_metaclass`
method):

[rhbz#1187882]: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1187882

    # yum --enablerepo=rawhide install python-six systemd

At this point, having upgraded `systemd`, you should probably reboot:

    # reboot

## Configure Docker

Once things are up and running, we will expect the `nova-compute`
service to launch Docker containers.  In order for this to work, the
`nova` user will need access to the Docker socket,
`/var/run/docker.sock`.  By default, this is owned by `root:root` and
has mode `660`:

    # ls -l /var/run/docker.sock
    srw-rw----. 1 root root 0 Feb  1 12:43 /var/run/docker.sock

The `nova-compute` service runs as the `nova` user and will not have
access to that socket.  There are a few ways of resolving this; an
expedient method is simply to make this socket owned by the `nova`
group, which we can do with `docker`'s `-G` option.

Edit `/etc/sysconfig/docker`, and modify the `OPTIONS=` line to look
like:

    OPTIONS='--selinux-enabled -G nova'

Then enable and start the `docker` service:

    # systemctl enable docker
    # systemctl start docker

## Install nova-docker

Clone the [nova-docker][] repository:

    # git clone http://github.com/stackforge/nova-docker.git
    # cd nova-docker

And check out the `stable/juno` branch, since we're operating with an
OpenStack Juno environment:

    # git checkout stable/juno

Now install the driver:

    # python setup.py install

## Configure Nova

Following the [README][] from [nova-docker][], we need to modify
the Nova configuration to use the `nova-docker` driver.  Edit
`/etc/nova/nova.conf` and add the following line to the `DEFAULT`
section:

[readme]: https://github.com/stackforge/nova-docker/blob/master/README.rst

    compute_driver=novadocker.virt.docker.DockerDriver

If there is already a line setting `compute_driver`, then comment it
out or delete before adding the new one.

Modify the Glance configuration to permit storage of Docker images.
Edit `/etc/glance/glance-api.conf`, and add the following line to the
`DEFAULT` section:

    container_formats=ami,ari,aki,bare,ovf,ova,docker

Next, we need to augment the `rootwrap` configuration such that
`nova-docker` is able run the `ln` command with `root` privileges.
We'll install the [docker.filters][] file from the `nova-docker`
source:

[docker.filters]: https://github.com/stackforge/nova-docker/blob/master/etc/nova/rootwrap.d/docker.filters

    # mkdir -p /etc/nova/rootwrap.d
    # cp etc/nova/rootwrap.d/docker.filters \
      /etc/nova/rootwrap.d/docker.filters

We've changed a number of configuration files, so we should restart
the affected services:

    # openstack-service restart nova glance

## Testing things out

Let's try starting a container!  We need to select one that will run
in the `nova-docker` environment.  Generally, that means one that does
not expect to have an interactive terminal and that will automatically
start some sort of web-accessible service.  I have a [minimal thttpd
container][thttpd] that fits the bill nicely:

[thttpd]: https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/larsks/thttpd/

    # docker pull larsks/thttpd

We need to store this image into Glance using the same name:

    # docker save larsks/thttpd | 
      glance image-create --name larsks/thttpd \
      --container-format docker --disk-format raw --is-public true

And now we should be able to start a container:

    # nova boot --image larsks/thttpd --flavor m1.tiny test0

After a bit, `nova list` should show:

    +------...+-------+--------+...+------------------+
    | ID   ...| Name  | Status |...| Networks         |
    +------...+-------+--------+...+------------------+
    | 430a1...| test0 | ACTIVE |...| private=10.0.0.6 |
    +------...+-------+--------+...+------------------+

And we should also see the container if we run `docker ps`:

    # docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
    ee864da30cf1        larsks/thttpd:latest   "/thttpd -D -l /dev/   7 hours ago         Up 7 hours                              nova-430a197e-a0ca-4e72-a7db-1969d0773cf7   

## Getting connected

At this point, the container will *not* be network accessible; it's
attached to a private tenant network.  Let's assign it a floating ip
address:

    # nova floating-ip-create public
    +--------------+-----------+----------+--------+
    | Ip           | Server Id | Fixed Ip | Pool   |
    +--------------+-----------+----------+--------+
    | 172.24.4.229 | -         | -        | public |
    +--------------+-----------+----------+--------+
    # nova floating-ip-associate test0 172.24.4.229

This isn't going to be immediately accessible because Packstack left
us without a route to the floating ip network.  We can fix that
temporarily like this:

    # ip addr add 172.24.4.225/28 dev br-ex

And now we can ping our Docker container:

    # ping -c2 172.24.4.229
    PING 172.24.4.229 (172.24.4.229) 56(84) bytes of data.
