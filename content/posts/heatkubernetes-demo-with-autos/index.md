title: Heat-kubernetes Demo with Autoscaling
---

Next week is the [Red Hat Summit][] in Boston, and I'll be taking part
in a [Project Atomic][] presentation in which I will discuss various
(well, two) options for deploying Atomic into an OpenStack
environment, focusing on my [heat-kubernetes][] templates.

As part of that presentation, I've put together a short demonstration video:

This shows off the autoscaling behavior available with recent versions
of these templates (and also serves as a very brief introduction to
working with Kubernetes).
