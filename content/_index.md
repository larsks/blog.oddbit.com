Hi there. Welcome to [`blog.oddbit.com`](https://blog.oddbit.com)! I post articles here on a variety of technical topics. Mostly I'm posting for myself (writing things up helps me remember them in the future), but I always hope the content I put here is helpful to someone else. If you find something here useful and want to say thanks, feel free to [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/oddbit)!
