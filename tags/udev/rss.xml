Unfortunately, they have a cheap CH340 serial adapter on board, which means that from the perspective of Linux these devices are all functionally identical &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s no way to identify one device from another. This by itself would be a manageable problem, except that the device names assigned to these devices aren&amp;rsquo;t constant: depending on the order in which they get plugged in (and the order in which they are detected at boot), a device might be &lt;code&gt;/dev/ttyUSB0&lt;/code&gt; one day and &lt;code&gt;/dev/ttyUSB2&lt;/code&gt; another day.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
