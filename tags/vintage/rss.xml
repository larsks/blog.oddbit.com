&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re not limited to watching output; you can use Slow to run interactive terminal sessions. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>vi&lt;/code> at 300 bps:&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>(We&amp;rsquo;re using &lt;code>busybox vi&lt;/code> here because many modern text editors spend too much redrawing the screen to be useful at low bitrates.)&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
