If you miss that as much as I do, let me introduce you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/larsks/slow">Slow&lt;/a>, a low bit rate emulator that lets you travel back in time to those simpler days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slow lets you run commands with a reduced output character rate. For example, we can ask for the date at speeds of 50, 75, and 110 bps:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="left" >
&lt;img src="slow-date.gif" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re not limited to just watching output; you can use Slow to run interactive terminal sessions. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>vi&lt;/code> at 300 bps:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="left" >
&lt;img src="slow-vi-300bps.gif" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>And the same thing at 2400 bps:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="left" >
&lt;img src="slow-vi-2400bps.gif" />
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>(We&amp;rsquo;re using &lt;code>busybox vi&lt;/code> in these examples because many modern text editors spend too much redrawing the screen to be useful at low bit rates.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Combine this with something like &lt;a href="https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term">Cool Retro Term&lt;/a> for a realistic vintage computing experience!&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
