workplace has been migrated over to Gmail as well. I find that for my
work email I rely much more extensively on filters and labels to
organize things (like zillions of internal and upstream mailing
lists), and that has posed some challenges. While Gmail is in general
fairly snappy, attempting to apply an action to thousands of messages
(for example, trying to mark 16000 messages as &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo;, or applying a
new filter to all your existing messages) results in a very poor
experience: it is not possible to interact with Gmail (in the same
tab) while the action is running, and frequently actions will timeout.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
