it&amp;rsquo;s become very disruptive. Tasks that used to take a few seconds
will now churn along for 15-20 minutes or longer before completing,
which is incredibly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first went looking to see if there was a PyPi mirror infrastructure,
like we see with &lt;a href="https://www.cpan.org/"&gt;CPAN&lt;/a&gt; for Perl or &lt;a href="https://ctan.org/"&gt;CTAN&lt;/a&gt; for Tex (and similarly
for most Linux distributions). There is apparently no such beast,&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
