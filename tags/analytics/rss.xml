trouble tickets (around 15000 documents total). We wanted to see what
sort of things are generating the most work for our helpdesk staff so
that we can identify areas in which improvements would have the
biggest impact. One of my colleagues took a first pass at the data by
manually categorizing the tickets based on their subject. This
resulted in some useful data, but in the end just over 40% of the
tickets are still uncategorized.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
