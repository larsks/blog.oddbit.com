Due to its low cost, this is a very popular radio, and there is excellent open source software available for programming it in the form of the &lt;a href="https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home"&gt;CHIRP&lt;/a&gt; project. After futzing around with the UV-5R for a while, I wanted to get something a little nicer for use at home, so I purchased a &lt;a href="https://www.kenwood.com/usa/com/amateur/tm-v71a/"&gt;Kenwood TM-V71A&lt;/a&gt;. CHIRP claims to have support for this radio as well, but it turns out it&amp;rsquo;s not very good: it uses a &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; connection so every time you edit a channel it tries to update the radio. This result in a slow and flaky UI, especially when trying to make bulk changes (like relocating a block of channels). I ended up using Kenwood&amp;rsquo;s official &lt;a href="https://www.kenwood.com/i/products/info/amateur/mcp_2a.html"&gt;MCP-2A&lt;/a&gt; software running on a Windows guest on my system, which works but isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal. I decided to learn more about how the radio interacts with the computer to see if I could improve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
