I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href="https://disqus.com"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; for a while, since when I started it was one of the only games in town. There are now alternatives of different sorts, and one in particular caught my eye: &lt;a href="https://utteranc.es/"&gt;Utterances&lt;/a&gt; uses GitHub issues for storing comments, which seems like a fantastic idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that comments will finally be stored in the same place as the blog content, which I think is a happy state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
