past week I finally broke down and bought one (with Cherry MX Brown switches).
The Vortex Core is a 40% keyboard, which means it consists primarily of letter
keys, a few lonely bits of punctuation, and several modifier keys to activate
different layers on the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="physical-impressions"&gt;Physical impressions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a really cute keyboard. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of MX brown switches, and this
keyboard is really a joy to type on, at least when you&amp;rsquo;re working primarily
with the alpha keys. I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring out where some of the punctuation
is, and with a few exceptions I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet spent time trying to remap
things into more convenient positions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Some thoughts on Mechanical Keyboards</title><link>https://blog.oddbit.com/post/2020-04-15-some-thoughts-on-mechanical-ke/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.oddbit.com/post/2020-04-15-some-thoughts-on-mechanical-ke/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Since we&amp;rsquo;re all stuck in the house and working from home these days, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to make some changes to my home office. One change in particular was requested by my wife, who now shares our rather small home office space with me: after a week or so of calls with me clattering away on my old Das Keyboard 3 Professional in the background, she asked if I could get something that was maybe a little bit quieter.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
