This past weekend, I joined my daughter on a scout camping trip to a campground without readily accessible electricity. This would be the first time I found myself in this situation, and as the date approached, I realized I was going to have to build or buy some sort of battery solution for my CPAP.</description><content>&lt;p>A year or so ago I was diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea">sleep apnea&lt;/a>, and since them I&amp;rsquo;ve been sleeping with a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_positive_airway_pressure">CPAP&lt;/a>. This past weekend, I joined my daughter on a &lt;a href="https://www.scouting.org/scoutsbsa/">scout&lt;/a> camping trip to a &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/locations/harold-parker-state-forest">campground&lt;/a> without readily accessible electricity. This would be the first time I found myself in this situation, and as the date approached, I realized I was going to have to build or buy some sort of battery solution for my CPAP. I opted for the &amp;ldquo;build&amp;rdquo; option because it seemed like a fun project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is what I ended up with:&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It has a pair of 10Ah SLA batteries, two 12V ports, two USB charging ports, and an integrated 4A charger (just plug in an extension cord and it&amp;rsquo;s all set). There are fuses on all of the output ports.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I spent some time looking at battery options. I wanted something that would easily last a couple of nights. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.resmed.com/us/dam/documents/articles/198103_battery-guide_glo_eng.pdf">documentation from ResMed&lt;/a>, my AirSense CPAP draws around 1A when the heat and humidity are disabled. That means for two nights, with the heat and humidity off, I&amp;rsquo;ll need at least 16Ah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I looked at some &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate_battery">LiFePO4&lt;/a> batteries, but they were typically two- to three- times the cost of an equivalent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealed_lead-acid_battery">SLA&lt;/a> battery. I ended up purchasing a pair of 10Ah SLA batteries. Testing confirms that it does last for two nights. With the integrated 4A charger, they charge up relatively quickly as well (for a single night of use, it took around an hour for a full charge).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The batteries are held in place by a roughly U-shaped piece of wood on the bottom of the case. The charger and the foam bad hold the batteries in when the top is closed.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I used a 1 1/8&amp;quot; hole saw to make the holes for the 12V and USB ports and a 2&amp;quot; hole saw for the through-plug on the back. I used a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OEPYWK">step bit&lt;/a> to drill the smaller holes for the switches.&lt;/p>
