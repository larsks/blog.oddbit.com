At first glance it reminds me of the Radio Shack (remember when they were cool?) electronics kit I had when I was a kid &amp;ndash; but somewhat more advanced. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to take a closer look, but given shipping these days means it&amp;rsquo;s probably a month away at least.</description><content>&lt;p>The folks at &lt;a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/">Seeed Studio&lt;/a> have just released the &lt;a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Beginner-Kit-for-Arduino-p-4549.html">Grove Beginner Kit for
Arduino&lt;/a>, and they asked if I would be willing to take a look at it in
exchange for a free kit. At first glance it reminds me of the Radio Shack
(remember when they were cool?) electronics kit I had when I was a kid &amp;ndash; but
somewhat more advanced. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to take a closer look, but given shipping
these days means it&amp;rsquo;s probably a month away at least.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>An interesting feature of the kit is that while everything is hardwired
together (so you can use it &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo; without any jumper wires, etc),
most of the components can be snapped out so that they can be used on their
own. Once separated, components can be connected using a Grove connector on
each piece.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The kit includes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A LED&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A buzzer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A 0.96&amp;quot; OLED Display 0.96&amp;quot;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A button&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A rotary potentiometer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A light&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A sound sensor&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A BMP280 air pressure sensor&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A 3LIS3DHTR 3-axis accelerometer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A &lt;a href="http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino_Lotus/">Seeduino Lotus&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It seems like an interesting mix of sensors for someone just getting started with Arduino programming. I&amp;rsquo;ll let you know how it looks in practice as soon as it arrives.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
