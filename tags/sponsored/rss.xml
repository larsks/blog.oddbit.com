Arduino&lt;/a&gt;, and they asked if I would be willing to take a look at it in
exchange for a free kit. At first glance it reminds me of the Radio Shack
(remember when they were cool?) electronics kit I had when I was a kid &amp;ndash; but
somewhat more advanced. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to take a closer look, but given shipping
these days means it&amp;rsquo;s probably a month away at least.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
